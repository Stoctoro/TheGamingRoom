# TheGamingRoom

- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was the owner of the game "Draw It or Lose It" which was only available as an Android app. The client wanted there game to be extended to a web-based platform, and wanted our help designing the intial environment software.

- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I made good use of pseudocode and thoroughly explained how each of the environment's objects interacted.

- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Since I already knew how the system was going to be laid out before coding, I didn't have to do any designing when I actually got into an IDE. All I had to do was implement the concepts that I already had, it made coding the classes much faster.

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would definately revise the stuff on system architecture. While I assert that the client in this situation would not need any specialized architecture, I don't fully comprehend the differences between systems because the tend to operate the same for a user.

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
User needs can vary in level. Some needs may need to be hard coded into the environment while others would need to be implemented in network structure. I implemented what needs I could into the code of the environment, anything that was higher level I made sure to write down in the design doc.

- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My main strategy for designing software is to limit responsibiity. Objects should be contained to specific behaviors and functions should only serve one purpose. I tried to design my code with this in mind, and it gave the software much more structure than it would've had otherwise. You end up with more lines of code this way, but it is much more practical to maintain between numberous developers.
